        <p>This tour is the best opportunity to get acquainted with the diversity of nature in Kazakhstan in 2 days. The program was designed specifically for people seeking solitude with wildlife.

          The road through the Assy Plateau is a heavy off-road that crosses 3 climatic zones from alpine meadows to steppes and semi-deserts. A tourist bus and unprepared transport will not go here. The change of landscapes and height differences are very intense and make the two-day tour unique.</p>
